This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To check if you have Node.js installed, run:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

1. In the project directory, run the following code to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the app in the development mode by using:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    Once you complete the above process, navigate to `/src/components` directory. Inside of it, you will find all the pages and components used within the template. You can then modify texts, pictures, and other information to your own.

    The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

You can choose your favorite service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub pages. Follow the instructions below to complete the production deploy.

            ...
